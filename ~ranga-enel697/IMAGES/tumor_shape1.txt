col 1: 1 = benign mass (28), 2 = malignant tumor (26)

col 2: compactness, modified to be in the range (0, 1)

col 3: fcc/fcx (see next two columns)

col 4: fractional convexity fcx in the range (0, 1)

col 5: fractional concavity fcc in the range (0, 1)

col 6: spiculation index SI in the range (0, 2)
